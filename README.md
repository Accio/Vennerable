# Vennerable
Vennerable provides Venn diagrams in R. 
It displays Venn and Euler diagrams for up to 9 different sets and using a variety of geometries. 
It allows the display of area-weighted Venn diagrams and allows fine graphical control over the result.

This package is not on CRAN. To install it, try something like
`install.packages("devtools");library(devtools);install_github("js229/Vennerable")`

Vennerable requires some BioConductor packages (hint: make sure BioC software is highlighted in the  Packages/Set Repository... menu)

The function based documentations is sketchy. A better guide is the Venn vignette which you can see with
`library(Vennerable);vignette("Venn")`
